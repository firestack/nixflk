# Introduction
Nixflk is a template which grants a simple way to use, deploy and manage
[NixOS][nixos] systems for personal and productive use. It does this by
providing a sane repository structure, integrating several popular projects
like [home-manager][home-manager], setting clear guidelines, offering useful
conveniences, and eliminating boilerplate so you can focus on deploying your
systems.

## Community Profiles
There are two branches from which to choose: core and community. The commuity
branch builds on core and includes several ready-made profiles for
discretionary employment.

### ⚠ Advisory
Nixflk leverages the [flakes][flakes] feature available via an _experimental_
branch of [nix][nix]. Until nix 3.0 is released, this project should be
considered unstable.
